/* Once again we get a Segmentation fault: 11 error.
The reason we get this error is becuase in the setArr 
function we are assigning *arr[index] = &i. This incorrect.
as *arr[index] is referring to the value stored at the address
that arr[index] points to. arr[index] still has not been
assigned an address to point to. &i refers to the memory address
of the integer i variable. So *arr[index] = &i, is incorrect, as
you are trying to store an address of a variable as the value of 
the address that the pointer is pointing to, which it has been 
assigned one yet. The correct statement would be to have
arr[index] = &i.
